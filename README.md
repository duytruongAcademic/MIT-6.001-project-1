Brute Force and Greedy Algorithm

A colony of Aucks (super-intelligent alien bioengineers) has landed on Earth 
and has created new species of farm animals! The Aucks are performing their experiments on Earth, 
and plan on transporting the mutant animals back to their home planet of Aurock. 

In this problem set, you will implement algorithms to figure out how the aliens should 
shuttle their experimental animals back across space.

Greedy Cow Transport( Greedy algorithm):
One way of transporting cows is to always pick the heaviest cow that will fit onto the spaceship first. 
This is an example of a greedy algorithm. So if there are only 2 tons of free space on your spaceship, 
with one cow that's 3 tons and another that's 1 ton, the 1 ton cow will get put onto the spaceship.

Brute Force Cow Transport( Brute Force algoritm):
Another way to transport the cows is to look at every possible combination of trips and pick the best one
